# SudokuSolver
Recursive backtracking algorithm to solve 9x9 sudoku puzzles. Takes 2D int array as an input and write solution into console.

Example Input : 
```cs
int[][] puzzle = new[]
{
    new [] { 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0},
    new [] { 0, 0, 8, 3, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0},
    new [] { 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1},
    new [] { 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6},
    new [] { 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0},
    new [] { 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4},
    new [] { 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2},
    new [] { 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0},
    new [] { 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 7, 0}
};
```

Corresponding Output:
```
9 6 3 1 7 4 2 5 8
1 7 8 3 2 5 6 4 9
2 5 4 6 8 9 7 3 1
8 2 1 4 3 7 5 9 6
4 9 6 8 5 2 3 1 7
